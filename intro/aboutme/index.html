    <h2>Jose Velastegui</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Jose and I'm from Ecuador. This is my second semester at BYU Idaho,
      I'm studying software engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      About my hobbies, I like to play piano, cooking, go to the gym, video
      games, and watch series.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took this course because web development is extremely important in
      software development, and I would like to learn so that later on, I can do
      my own projects.
    </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church all my life.</p>
